# GH_Tools
#### Game Hacking Tools for Java
`GH_Tools` is a wrapper around [**JNA**](https://github.com/java-native-access) makes it easier to use and provides some new functionality for game hacking as well.

### Installing

- To use `GH_Tools` you can either download it from [**here**](https://github.com/Erarnitox/GH_Tools/releases) and import in in your project.

- Or get the source (Eclipse project) for it [**here**](https://github.com/Erarnitox/GH_Tools/GH_Tools).

### Usage
#### Package Overview
All Classes can be found in the package `com.guidedhacking.GH_Tools`. In this Overview we will have a brief look at its classes and their most often used methods.

##### GHArchitecture
Is a pure Enum type with the following Options:
- ###### Win32
- ###### Win64

##### GHInput
Unlike build in methods these will also work when the program is out of focus.

**Methods:**

- ###### boolean getKeyDown(int key)
returns `true` if the key is pressed and `false` otherwise.

- ###### boolean getKeyPress(int key)
returns `true` once if the key got pressed and `false` otherwise.

- ###### void sendKeyPress(int key)
simulate a full key press and release.

- ###### void sendKeyDown(int key)
simulate a key press.

- ###### void sendKeyUp(int key)
simulate a key release.

- ###### void SetCursor(int x, int y)
set the position of the cursor to the specified position.

- ###### int[] getCursorPos()
returns an int array whit 2 elements. where the first element is the x-coordinate and the second value is the y-coordinate of the cursor.

##### GHMemory
Used to access the memory of another process.

**Methods:**

- ###### boolean openProcess(String windowName)
Open a handle to the process with this window name to be able to access its memory. Returns `true` if it was successful and `false` otherwise.

- ###### void setArchitecture(GHArchitecture architecture)
Used to set the architecture to the architecture of the game to use the correct pointer size.

- ###### long getObjectAddress(GHPointer staticMultiLevelPointer)
calculates the runtime address from the static pointer provided.

- ###### void close()
Close the handle you have opened to the game.

- ###### boolean isConnected()
Checks if the handle to the game is still open. Will return `true` if the handle is still open and `false` if its closed.

- ###### boolean readBit(long address, int position)
Used to read a single bit from memory. Return `true` if its 1 or `false` if its 0.

- ###### byte readByte(long address)
Returns the byte that can be found at the provided address in the memory.

- ###### short readShort(long address)
Returns the short that can be found at the provided address in the memory.

- ###### char readChar(long address)
Returns the char that can be found at the provided address in the memory.

- ###### int readInt(long address)
Returns the int that can be found at the provided address in the memory.

- ###### long readLong(long address)
Returns the long that can be found at the provided address in the memory.

- ###### float readFloat(long address)
Returns the float that can be found at the provided address in the memory.

- ###### double readDouble(long address)
Returns the double that can be found at the provided address in the memory.

- ###### readString(long address , int bytestoread)
Returns the String that can be found at the provided address in the memory.

- ###### byte[] readByteArray(long address, int bytesToRead)
Returns the byte[] that starts at the provided address with the provided length.

- ###### boolean writeBit(boolean data, long address, int position)
Write a single bit to memory (`true` for 1 and `false` for 0) to the specified position in the byte that can be found at the specified address.
Will `return` true if successful and `false` otherwise.

- ###### boolean writeByte(byte data, long address)
Write a single byte to the specified address in memory.
Will `return` true if successful and `false` otherwise.

- ###### boolean writeShort(short data, long address)
Write a short to the specified address in memory.
Will `return` true if successful and `false` otherwise.

- ###### boolean writeChar(char data, long address)
Write a single char to the specified address in memory.
Will `return` true if successful and `false` otherwise.

- ###### boolean writeInt(int data, long address)
Write an int to the specified address in memory.
Will `return` true if successful and `false` otherwise.

- ###### boolean writeLong(long data, long address)
Write a long to the specified address in memory.
Will `return` true if successful and `false` otherwise.

- ###### boolean writeFloat(float data, long address)
Write a float to the specified address in memory.
Will `return` true if successful and `false` otherwise.

- ###### boolean writeDouble(double data, long address)
Write a double to the specified address in memory.
Will `return` true if successful and `false` otherwise.

- ###### boolean writeString(long address,String string)
Write a String to the specified address in memory.
Will `return` true if successful and `false` otherwise.

- ###### boolean write(byte[] data, long address)
Write a byte[] to memory starting at the provided address.
Will `return` true if successful and `false` otherwise.

this class also provides some methods for working with objects in memory. If you are interested in them check the source of this class [here](https://github.com/Erarnitox/GH_Tools/blob/master/GH_Tools/src/main/java/com/guidedhacking/GH_Tools/GHMemory.java). Please note that these methods are not tested!

##### GHPointer
Used to hold information about the static pointer and the offsets of a value.

**Constructor:**

- ###### GHPointer(long staticPointer, int ... offsets)

**Methods:**

- ###### long getStaticPointer()
- ###### int[] getOffsets()

##### GHTools

**Methods:**

- ###### boolean sleep(int time)
Sleep method with exception handeling.

- ###### int getGamePID()
Returns the process ID of the currently opened process.

- ###### boolean isGameVisible()
Return `true` if the game window is visible and `false` otherwise.

- ###### int getGameHeight()
Returns the height of the game window in pixels.

- ###### int getGameWidth()
Returns the width of the game window in pixels.

- ###### int getGameXPos()
Returns the x-position of the upper left corner of the game window on the sreeen.

- ###### int getGameYPos()
Returns the y-position of the upper left corner of the game window on the sreeen.

### Getting started

Once you have downloaded and imported [**GH_Tools**](https://github.com/Erarnitox/GH_Tools/releases) into your project you can get started coding your first hack for a game.

here is a very simple example on how to use `GH_Tools`

```
//import everything from the GH_Tools:
import com.guidedhacking.GH_Tools*; 

public class Example {
	
	//create a new pointer with the static address and offsets:
	private static GHPointer healthPtr  = new GHPointer(0x2DEAD,0x13); 
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		//try to open a handle to the game process:
		if(GHMemory.openProcess("Game Window Title")) {
			
			//select the architecture of the game:
			GHMemory.setArchitecture(GHArchitecture.Win32); 
			
			//calculate the runtime address of the health value from the pointer:
			long healthAddy = GHMemory.getObjectAddress(healthPtr); 
			
			//read the health value from the games memory:
			int healthValue = GHMemory.readInt(healthAddy); 
			
			//increase the health value by 1:
			healthValue++; 
			
			//write the new health value back to memory:
			GHMemory.writeInt(healthValue,healthAddy); 
			
		}else{ //if creating a handle to the game failed
			System.out.println("Can not open Game!");
		}
	}
}
```

for a more in depth example please have a look at the example hack i have made using an early version of GH_Tools [**here**](https://github.com/Erarnitox/java-game-hacking).
